Game of snake

Classical game of snake known from far back when we had it on our Nokia 3310 phones
The goal is to move the snake to the piece of food it eats so that it gets longer after each eaten piece
If the snake collides with the walls of the screen or with its own tail it's game over
The game also keeps score and remembers the highest achieved score.
